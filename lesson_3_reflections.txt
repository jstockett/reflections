What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When the comman git init is run it creates the .git file in the working directory.  The 
	.git file stores the meta data of the repository.  Git init does not perform a commit.  
	Running git status will show the current commit(this will show 'Initial commit' on a 
	newly created repository) and the tracked/untracked files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area shows which files you want to track.  By having a staging area git lets you choose which files to track and when to start tracking them.
