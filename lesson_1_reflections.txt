
Lesson 1: Navigating a Commit History

using the diff command made finding errors much faster than scanning the code manually
short lines of code make it easier to find errors using diff
command syntax is diff -u oneFileName anotherFileName (this is for linux or mac)
command syntax is FC oneFileName anotherFileName (this is for windows command prompt)

many systems use version control (dropbox, google docs/drive, wikipedia)
right click file in google drive and select Manage versions to see previous versions

as a programer version control would make it easier to find problems, experiment, 
and refine programs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

	pros - allows user to choose size of commit(and logically break commits into functional
	sizes), limit the amount of clutter in the version history, include commit notes

	cons - requires users to remember to commit versions

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	
	Git allows you to track interrelated files, since making changes in one file often
	requires changes in the related files
